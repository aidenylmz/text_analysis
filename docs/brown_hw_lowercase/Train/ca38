the/at augusta/np-tl national/jj-tl golf/nn-tl club/nn-tl course/nn-tl got/vbd up/rp and/cc bit/vbd both/abx player/np and/cc palmer/np ./.

half/abn an/at hour/nn after/cs he/pps finished/vbd his/pp$ round/nn ,/, player/np holed/vbd out/rp at/in the/at 18th/od green/nn with/in a/at 69/cd and/cc a/at three-round/jj total/nn of/in 206/cd ,/, four/cd strokes/nns ahead/rb of/in palmer/np ./.

on/in the/at final/jj round/nn at/in pensacola/np ,/, the/at luck/nn of/in the/at draw/nn paired/vbd palmer/np and/cc player/np in/in the/at same/ap threesome/nn and/cc ,/, although/cs it/pps was/bedz far/rb from/in obvious/jj at/in the/at time/nn ,/, the/at gallery/nn was/bedz treated/vbn to/in the/at first/od chapter/nn of/in what/wdt promises/vbz to/to be/be one/cd of/in the/at most/ql exciting/jj duels/nns in/in sport/nn for/in a/at long/jj time/nn to/to come/vb ./.

he/pps outplayed/vbd palmer/np all/ql around/in the/at course/nn and/cc finished/vbd with/in a/at tremendous/jj 65/cd to/in palmer's/np$ 71/cd ./.
thereafter/rb ,/, until/in the/at masters/nns-tl ,/, player/np gradually/rb increased/vbd his/pp$ lead/nn over/in palmer/np in/in winnings/nns and/cc added/vbd one/cd more/ap tournament/nn victory/nn at/in miami/np ./.
